    <p class="text">
      The blue-throated macaw (Ara glaucogularis; previously Ara caninde), also
      known as the Caninde macaw or Wagler's macaw, is a macaw endemic to a
      small area of north-central Bolivia, known as Los Llanos de Moxos. In 2014
      this species was designated by law as a natural patrimony of Bolivia,
      where it is known as barba azul, which means 'blue beard' in Spanish.
      Until 2010, it was hunted by natives to make feathered "Moxe√±o"
      headdresses for "machetero" ritual dances.
