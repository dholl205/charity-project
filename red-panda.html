      The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a carnivoran native to the eastern
      Himalayas and southwestern China. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN
      Red List because the wild population is estimated at fewer than 10,000
      mature individuals and continues to decline due to habitat loss and
      fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression. Despite its name, it
      is not closely related to the giant panda. The red panda has reddish-brown
      fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front
      legs; it is roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body.
      It is arboreal and feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and
      insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is
      largely sedentary during the day. It is also called the lesser panda, the
      red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear.
