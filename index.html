    We are here to help animals from going extinct. We need money to do this
    though. If we can get enough money, we can save animals.

  <body class="who">
    <p>
      We are the Foundation of Saving Animals. We save animals that are
      endangered, threatened, extinct in the wild, and more. We have been able
      to save multiple animals with funds that are given to us by contributors.
      We have so far been able to save about 500 Red Pandas, 200 Black Rhinos,
      13 Blue-throated Macaws, 50 Sea Otters, and 350 Snow Leopards.
