    <p class="text">
      The snow leopard (Panthera uncia), also known as the ounce, is a felid in
      the genus Panthera native to the mountain ranges of Central and South
      Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because the global
      population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and
      is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is threatened by poaching and
      habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits
      alpine and subalpine zones at elevations from 3,000 to 4,500 m (9,800 to
      14,800 ft), ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the
      Tibetan Plateau, to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. In the
      northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.
